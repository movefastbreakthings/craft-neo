/**
 * Deletes any Neo blocks that do not have a `sortOrder`.
 *
 * The `sortOrder` property was added in Neo 2.7.0, and Neo blocks were assigned a `sortOrder` from their associated
 * `lft` value in the `structureelements` table. Any Neo blocks created prior to Neo 2.7.0, not associated with a block
 * structure and yet have remained in the system, will have a `sortOrder` of `null`. These blocks can cause errors with
 * the updates in Neo 2.8.14 to apply field propagation methods to their blocks; since these blocks don't belong to any
 * block structure, they can be safely deleted.
