### Plugin Store
Open the control panel for your website. Navigate to **Settings &rarr; Plugins** and search for **Neo**. Click **Install**.

### Composer
Run the following command in the root directory of your Craft project:
```
composer require spicyweb/craft-neo
```


## Requirements

### Craft version
Neo requires Craft CMS 3.1.20 or later.

### PHP version

### Browser support

- Edge
- Chrome 40+

While Neo may work on browsers and versions outside of those listed, the above list is what Neo explicitly supports. The best option is to use an up-to-date major browser.
